# Promise-like

```

  idle ->
    // Behaves a bit like a JS Promise
    pending ->
      (rejected | resolved) ->
    idle

```

A small demonstration of [Statebot-sh](https://github.com/shuckster/statebot-sh), a state-machine for shell-scripts.

Have a look at the source-code and run it a few times to see how it behaves. :)

Reset it like this:

```sh
./demo.sh reset
```
