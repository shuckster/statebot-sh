#
# If you want to hook-into Statebot-sh transitions without modifying
# your Statebot-sh scripts, you can put an on_transitions() function
# in a ~/.statebot-rc file and use STATEBOT_NAME to know which machine
# is currently running.
#
# The example below takes this a step further and allows you to create
# on_transitions() functions in separate files within your home folder,
# which will be sourced by machine-name.
#
# So if you have a Statebot-sh script with a machine called "example",
# create an on_transitions() function inside a file called
# ~/_on_transitions_example and it will be sourced after the
# `statebot_init` API method is called in your original script.
#

if [ -f "${HOME}/_on_transitions_${STATEBOT_NAME}" ]
then
  . "${HOME}/_on_transitions_${STATEBOT_NAME}"
